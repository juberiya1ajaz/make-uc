# ClinicalCue

## 💡 Inspiration

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

There is no easy way to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. However, there are some things that can be done to help diagnose the disease. Neurological tests are much better ways to diagnose the disease. MoCA(Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a gold standard test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.

## 💻 What it does

ClinicalCue is a web application where users can take a Parkinson's test to check if they have Parkinson's or not. We also have a storytelling game, especially for elderly people to diagnose Alzheimer's and improve cognitive skills. The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people to find the right medical care/supervision for themselves.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Node Js: For backend
- AWS: For training the model
- Hedera: For deploying smart contracts
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 🤖 [AWS] Greatest Social Impact

We are using AWS to train our model. We are using AWS Sagemaker to train our model. We are using AWS Lambda to deploy our model. We are using AWS API Gateway to deploy our model. We are using AWS S3 to store our data. We are using AWS CloudWatch to monitor our model.

## 🏥 [Medpace] Set The Pace

We have a page where users can come and upload their data that can be used for training the model. In return for the data, we will give them an NFT. The NFT token can be used to buy medicines from our pharmacy. We have a smart contract that will be deployed on Hedera Hashgraph. The smart contract will be used to store the data and the tokens. The data will be used to train the model and the tokens will be used to buy medicines from our pharmacy.

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to deploy our **smart contracts**. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As We don't have any experience with ML, We learned how to use AWS to build the ML model.
- It was the first time We used the AWS Machine so We had to learn how to use it.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project in the given time frame.
- Using AWS to train the model.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to use AWS to predict the disease.

## 🚀 What's next for ClinicalCue

- Building a mobile app
- Deploying the web app.
- Improving the accuracy of the model.
