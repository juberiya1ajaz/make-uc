# APP NAME

## 💡 Inspiration

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

There is no easy way to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. However, there are some things that can be done to help diagnose the disease. Neurological tests are much better ways to diagnose the disease. MoCA(Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a gold standard test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.

## 💻 What it does

APP NAME is a web application where users can take a Parkinson's test to check if they have Parkinson's or not. We also have a storytelling game, especially for elderly people to diagnose Alzheimer's and improve cognitive skills. The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people to find the right medical care/supervision for themselves.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Node Js: For backend
- AWS: For training the model
- Tailwind: For styling and animations

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As I don't have any experience with ML, I learned how to use AWS to build the ML model.
- It was the first time I used the AWS Machine so I had to learn how to use it.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project in the given time frame.
- Using the Google AWS to train the model.

## 📖 What we learned

- How to use AWS to predict the disease.

## 🚀 What's next for APP NAME

- Building a mobile app
- Deploying the web app.
- Improving the accuracy of the model.
